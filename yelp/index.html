								<h3>Influence maximization based on user's history<br /></h3>
							</header>
							<p>Once we discover the user's history on the social network, we calculate an impact coefficient. <br/> This impact coefficient is the probability that a given user can influence another one. <br/> The more active you were on Yelp.. the more probability you have to influence other people!</p>

								<h3>A community based approach<br /></h3>
							</header>
							<p>We use popular community detection algorithms to discover communities among the social network itself. <br/> Analyzing the community's structure we attempt to find the most influential user.<br/> Biggest communities are our main focus and concern! The bigger the community, the more I want to target it for analysis</p>

The probabilities are of course based on the coefficient we previously calculated ."})
