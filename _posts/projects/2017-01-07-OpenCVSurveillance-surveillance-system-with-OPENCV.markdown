OpenCVSurveillance is an old project that was created by myself and a buddy of mine in the 2nd year of University for a "Multimedia system" exam. 

The software creates ".gif" animated files that are recordings of your webcam when movement is detected.
Initially it captures .jpegs frame-by-frame then merges them in a single .gif. OpenCV was used especially with the wonderful "backgroundsubtractor" component.
